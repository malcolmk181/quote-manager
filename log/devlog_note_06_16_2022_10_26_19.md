### Note
Today, going to be working on:
- adding color to my project today with [Colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize "Colorize Github")
- adding 10 more seeds, preferably with some existing authors and sources
- adding a feature to list the sources of artist somewhere
- add a 'this author / topic has no quotes, would you like to remove them from the database?' when you delete the last quote of an author / topic

What should be my color scheme be? Is it a safe assumption to say that most people will use a terminal with a dark background?
- how should I convey meaning with color?
- it looks like I can change both the color of the text, and its background color, independently. And underline? What is `.blink`?

- .blink doesn't seem to do anything?
  - ok looks like its my terminal/vs code theme settings nvm

Colorize stuff
```ruby
# Colors
[:black, :light_black, :red, :light_red, :green, :light_green, :yellow, :light_yellow, :blue, :light_blue, :magenta, :light_magenta, :cyan, :light_cyan, :white, :light_white, :default]

# Color codes
{:black=>0, :light_black=>60, :red=>1, :light_red=>61, :green=>2, :light_green=>62, :yellow=>3, :light_yellow=>63, :blue=>4, :light_blue=>64, :magenta=>5, :light_magenta=>65, :cyan=>6, :light_cyan=>66, :white=>7, :light_white=>67, :default=>9}

# Gives a sample palette of colors
String.color_samples

# Modes
[:default, :bold, :italic, :underline, :blink, :swap, :hide]

# Mode codes
{:default=>0, :bold=>1, :italic=>3, :underline=>4, :blink=>5, :swap=>7, :hide=>8}
```

White looks good on black, light_black, red, light_blue, magenta

Black looks good on green, yellow, blue, cyan, white

Colors basically don't work on color backgrounds - they turn to white or black

Everything looks good on black tbh

Nothing really looks good on light black

Most look good on default

### strategy
- prompts for user input are `cyan`
- quotes are `italic`
- options for selection are `yellow`
