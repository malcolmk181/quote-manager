### Note
Today, going to be working on:
- adding color to my project today with [Colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize "Colorize Github")
- adding 10 more seeds, preferably with some existing authors and sources
- adding a feature to list the sources of artist somewhere
- add a 'this author / topic has no quotes, would you like to remove them from the database?' when you delete the last quote of an author / topic
