### Note
- Installed devlog package to keep track of thoughts during development. Cool!
- I'll use these to help make the blog / process

Previously, I decided that I want to make a quote manager. I really like collecting quotes, so I figured it would be a fun project that I might actually use. It also fits within the spec well, since I can easily make a 3-model database to handle the data.

I want to store a quote with some properties:
- the actual quote itself
- the author
- the source (like the book, article, etc)
- a url
- year
- its topic(s)

The 3 models that I came up with from this idea are Quotes, Authors, and Topics. I thought about making Sources a model as well, but I think it works well enough to have the source included as part of the quote object. I don't intend for the source to be some super defined data - it's ok if its the name and page number from a book in one, and an interview in another.

My other idea (should I have used an API) would have been to use the [NewsCatcher API](https://docs.newscatcherapi.com/api-docs/quick-start) to pull news articles from NewsCatcher and organize them by search terms, etc. into a library of articles to read. Like a "read me later" supply. Then I could mark articles as read, mark them as favorites, etc., and organize them by author, topic, date, etc.
