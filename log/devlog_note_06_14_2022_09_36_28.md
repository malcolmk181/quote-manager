### Note
What should be guaranteed to be not null?
- message
- author
- topic

Those are my 3 models so I think that makes sense. created_at and updated_at are also not null by default

I want to add text formatting, will definitely be looking into that.
- looks like [Colorize](https://github.com/fazibear/colorize) is what I'm looking for :)

When I call functions without arguments on their own line in my `bin/run` file, I'm adding the parenthesis - `click_to_continue()` - to make it very clear I am calling a function. IDK if this breaks ruby convention or not, but to me, it's clear that I am calling a function, rather than maybe returning a variable or something.
