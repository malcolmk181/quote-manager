### Note
- Randomly decided to look into a python analogy for activerecord for sqlite. note to look into [SQLiteModel](https://pypi.org/project/sqlitemodel/)
- added my models and migrated
- what should my license be?
- couldn't get the embed to work for the database model diagram and github, what a shame. just uploaded a png export instead
- need to add running instructions to readme
